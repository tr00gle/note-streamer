# Node Note Streamer

This is package designed to take lines of text input via the terminal, transform those lines, and then stream them directly to a markdown file. 

## Installation 

## Use


## What should we be able to do? 

The goal here is to run a node program that does the following:
1. takes single-line notes from standard input 
2. Transforms those notes into bulleted list items (markdown)
3. Writes them to a file as we go. 
4. Takes a command to close/end the stream 
5. The notes file's title should be of the form <date> <domain> <domainModifier> notes
